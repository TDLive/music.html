how to
======

1. **Find a host and download the /music.html file.** I've found Dropbox hosts HTML files well. You can also just fork this repository (make sure you're editing the /index.html in the gh-pages branch and you delete the CNAME file).
2. **Edit the music.html file.** Follow the instructions next to the s() method to add songs to the list in the order you want.
3. Upload/push
4. ???
5. Profit!!
